# GuessTheNumber
Description
This is a simple Python-based number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number. Additionally, the player has the option to play the game multiple times.

How to Play
Start the Game: Run the script to start the game. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
Make a Guess: The player will be prompted to guess the number.
Receive Feedback: The program will inform the player if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
Continue Guessing: If the guess is incorrect, the player can continue guessing until the correct number is guessed.
End of Game: Once the correct number is guessed, the program will display the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
Play Again: The player will be asked if they want to play again. Enter "yes" to start a new game or "no" to exit.
Code Explanation
The code is structured to include a function play_game() that encapsulates the game logic, and a loop to allow the player to play multiple times based on their input.
